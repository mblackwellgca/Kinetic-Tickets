## Description
* AS A service provider
    * I WANT a ticket system
    * SO THAT my company can receive support requests

This application was designed to have a simple ticketing system that is powerful, easy and efficient to use.

* Submit ticket
* Allows attachments
* Ticket Comments
* Edit Ticket
* Delete Ticket
* Username added to ticket
* Username added to comment
* Date added to ticket and comment

## Installation
* This application’s folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You’ll need to use the [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

    You’ll also need the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables, the [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords, the [Express-fileupload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-fileupload) for the user to upload files, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and[connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) packages to add authentication.

* **Note**: 
    The [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) package stores the session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the default behavior and you do not have to do anything to your application other than implement the npm package.
